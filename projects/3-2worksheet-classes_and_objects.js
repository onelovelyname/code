// Classes project - in groups of 2, create a class for a type you imagine: Animal, Person, Country...anything!
// Must have 3 methods and 5 properties
// Start with using the functional way of creating an object. If you have time, write it again using the class keyword

//======================Object literals==========================//

//write a literal object that contains at least 3 different properties and one method.

//the object can be anything you want: car, animal, country, person

//add a new property to your object using bracket-notation.

//change one of your object's properties using dot-notation.

//add a new property to your object using bracket-notation and a variable.

//The method can do anything you want. Call it.

//BONUS: write another method that -when called- logs one of the properties to the console using the 'this' keyword.

// write your code below this line

//===============================CLASSES====================================//

//write your previous object using a class. Make 3 different instances of your class.

//Also, add and change properties on your object using:

//1. dot notation.
//2. bracket notation.
//3 variable with bracket notation.

//BONUS: write another method that -when called- logs one of the properties to the console using the 'this' keyword.

//write your code here

//===============================functional classes=========================//

//write a function that returns an object (animal, car, person) each time it's called with 3 properties and two methods.

//call your function, and log the returned object to the console.

//write your code here.

//====

//write a class-based function that has three different properties and two methods which returns an object (animal, car, person) each time an instance is made.

//log each one of your instances to the console.

//BONUS: define another method on your class that -when called- logs one of the properties to the console using the 'this' keyword.

//write your code here.
