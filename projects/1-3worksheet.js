Basic Data Types and Functions Worksheet

// Problem One:
// The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.
// There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication *, division /, addition +, subtraction -, and so on.

// 1. Assign a variable n to a number
// 2. Log the variable n to the console
// 3. Reassign n to a new number
// 4. Log the variable n into the console again, what happens?
// 5. Try logging into the console different operations you can perform on n






// Problem Two:
// A string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes. In JavaScript, there are 3 types of quotes.
// Double quotes: "Hello".
// Single quotes: 'Hello'.
// Backticks: `Hello`.
// Backticks are “extended functionality” quotes. They allow us to embed variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in ${…}, for example:

// 1. Assign a variable to a string of your choosing
// 2. Log this variable into the console.
// 3. Try adding a number to the your variable, what happens? Why do you think this happens?
// 4. Try adding another string to the other your variable, what happens? Why do you think this happens
// 5. Console log a string and add the value of the variable n from the previous problem, did you use the addition symbol or backticks? Try both






// Problem Three:
// The boolean type has only two values: true and false.
// 1. This type is commonly used to store yes/no values: true means “yes, correct”, and false means “no, incorrect”.
// 2. Have a variable set to true, then in the next line, set the same variable to false
// 3. Talk to the person next to you on when and why would we use true or false in javascript





// Problem Four:
// The special null value does not belong to any of the types described above.
// It forms a separate type of its own which contains only the null value:

// The special value undefined also stands apart. It makes a type of its own, just like null.
// The meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”.
// If a variable is declared, but not assigned, then its value is undefined

// 1. Declare a variable with a name of your choosing to null
// 2. Declare a variable with the name of your choosing but 
// do not assign it to anything, try to log this into the console, what appears?
// 3. Discuss with a partner when would we use null, undefined?






// Problem Five:
// The object type is special.
// All other types are called “primitive” because their values can contain only a single thing (be it a string or a number or whatever). In contrast, objects are used to store collections of data and more complex entities. 

// 1. Create an object of yourself with your own properties
// 2. Try to log into the console the object
// 3. Can you log individual attributes? How?
// 4. Which situations would it be better to use an object rather than a primitive type of variable data type? When would it be better to use a primitive data type rather than an object? Discuss with a partner





// Extra Credit:
// What is the output for the code below?

let name = "Khader";
console.log(`hello ${1}`);

console.log(`hello ${"name"}`);

console.log(`hello ${name}`);



// Topic 4: Functions

// Write addition function using declaration






// Write multiplication function using expression







// Extra Credit: 

// How might you replicate the rock-paper-scissors game that we played yesterday in class?
// Work with a teammate on this question, and we'll review in class
