        Hello there! My name is Violet and I am a Computer Science graduate of
        London university. My short-term goal is to work as a software engineer
        at a company that recognizes my worth as an individual and encourages me
        to grow and learn. My long-term goal is to work as a teacher for a
        university teaching Computer Science and maybe start my own web
        development bootcamp as a side business.
